    <title>Persistence Contexts</title>

    <para>
        Both the <interfacename>org.hibernate.Session</interfacename> API and
        <interfacename>javax.persistence.EntityManager</interfacename> API represent a context for dealing with
        persistent data.  This concept is called a <literal>persistence context</literal>.  Persistent data has a
        state in relation to both a persistence context and the underlying database.

    <para>
        In Hibernate native APIs, the persistence context is defined as the
        <interfacename>org.hibernate.Session</interfacename>.  In JPA, the persistence context is defined by
        <interfacename>javax.persistence.EntityManager</interfacename>.  Much of the
        <interfacename>org.hibernate.Session</interfacename> and
        <interfacename>javax.persistence.EntityManager</interfacename> methods deal with moving entities between these
        states.
    </para>

    <section>
        <title>Making entities persistent</title>

        <para>
            Once you've created a new entity instance (using the standard <literal>new</literal> operator) it is in
            <literal>new</literal> state.   You can make it persistent by associating it to either a
            <interfacename>org.hibernate.Session</interfacename> or
            <interfacename>javax.persistence.EntityManager</interfacename>
        </para>

        <example>
            <title>Example of making an entity persistent</title>
            <programlisting>
<![CDATA[DomesticCat fritz = new DomesticCat();
fritz.setColor(Color.GINGER);
fritz.setSex('M');
fritz.setName("Fritz");
session.save(fritz);]]>
            </programlisting>
            <programlisting>
<![CDATA[DomesticCat fritz = new DomesticCat();
fritz.setColor(Color.GINGER);
fritz.setSex('M');
fritz.setName("Fritz");
entityManager.persist(fritz);]]>
            </programlisting>
        </example>

        <para>
            <interfacename>org.hibernate.Session</interfacename> also has a method named <methodname>persist</methodname>
            which follows the exact semantic defined in the JPA specification for the <methodname>persist</methodname>
            method.  It is this method on <interfacename>org.hibernate.Session</interfacename> to which the
            Hibernate <interfacename>javax.persistence.EntityManager</interfacename> implementation delegates.
        </para>

        <para>
            If the <classname>DomesticCat</classname> entity type has a generated identifier, the value is associated
            to the instance when the <methodname>save</methodname> or <methodname>persist</methodname> is called.  If the
            identifier is not automatically generated, the application-assigned (usually natural) key value has to be
            set on the instance before <methodname>save</methodname> or <methodname>persist</methodname> is called.
        </para>

    <section>
        <title>Deleting entities</title>
        <para>
            Entities can also be deleted.
        </para>
        <example>
            <title>Example of deleting an entity</title>
            <programlisting>
<![CDATA[session.delete( anAuthor );]]>
            </programlisting>
            <programlisting>
<![CDATA[entityManager.remove( anAuthor );]]>
            </programlisting>
        </example>
        <para>
            It is important to note that Hibernate itself can handle deleting detached state.  JPA, however, disallows
            it.  The implication here is that the entity instance passed to the
            <interfacename>org.hibernate.Session</interfacename> <methodname>delete</methodname> method can be either
            in managed or detached state, while the entity instance passed to <methodname>remove</methodname> on
            <interfacename>javax.persistence.EntityManager</interfacename> must be in managed state.
        </para>
    </section>

    <section>
        <title>Obtain an entity reference without initializing its data</title>
        <para>
            Sometimes referred to as lazy loading, the ability to obtain a reference to an entity without having to
            load its data is hugely important.  The most common case being the need to create an association between
            an entity and another, existing entity.
        </para>
        <example>
            <title>Example of obtaining an entity reference without initializing its data</title>
            <programlisting>
<![CDATA[Book book = new Book();
book.setAuthor( session.load( Author.class, authorId ) );]]>
            </programlisting>
            <programlisting>
<![CDATA[Book book = new Book();
book.setAuthor( entityManager.getReference( Author.class, authorId ) );]]>
            </programlisting>
        </example>
        <para>
            The above works on the assumption that the entity is defined to allow lazy loading, generally through
            use of runtime proxies.  For more information see <xref linkend="devguide-mappingEntities"/>.  In both
            cases an exception will be thrown later if the given entity does not refer to actual database state if and
            when the application attempts to use the returned proxy.
        </para>
    </section>

    <section>
        <title>Obtain an entity with its data initialized</title>

        <para>
            It is also quite common to want to obtain an entity along with with its data, for display for example.
        </para>
        <example>
            <title>Example of obtaining an entity reference with its data initialized</title>
            <programlisting>
<![CDATA[return session.get( Author.class, authorId );]]>
            </programlisting>
            <programlisting>
<![CDATA[return entityManager.find( Author.class, authorId );]]>
            </programlisting>
        </example>
        <para>
            In both cases null is returned if no matching database row was found.
        </para>
    </section>

    <section>
        <title>Refresh entity state</title>

        <para>
            You can reload an entity instance and it's collections at any time.
        </para>

        <example>
            <title>Example of refreshing entity state</title>
            <programlisting>
<![CDATA[Cat cat = session.get( Cat.class, catId );
...
session.refresh( cat );]]>
            </programlisting>
            <programlisting>
<![CDATA[Cat cat = entityManager.find( Cat.class, catId );
...
entityManager.refresh( cat );]]>
            </programlisting>
        </example>

        <para>
            One case where this is useful is when it is known that the database state has changed since the data was
            read.  Refreshing allows the current database state to be pulled into the entity instance and the
            persistence context.
        </para>

        <para>
            Another case where this might be useful is when database triggers are used to initialize some of the
            properties of the entity.  Note that only the entity instance and its collections are refreshed unless you
            specify <literal>REFRESH</literal> as a cascade style of any associations.  However, please note that
            Hibernate has the capability to handle this automatically through its notion of generated properties.
            See <xref linkend="devguide-mappingEntities"/> for information.
        </para>
    </section>

    <section>
        <title>Modifying managed/persistent state</title>

        <para>
            Entities in managed/persistent state may be manipulated by the application and any changes will be
            automatically detected and persisted when the persistence context is flushed. There is no need to call a
            particular method to make your modifications persistent.
        </para>

        <example>
            <title>Example of modifying managed state</title>
            <programlisting>
<![CDATA[Cat cat = session.get( Cat.class, catId );
cat.setName( "Garfield" );
session.flush(); // generally this is not explicitly needed]]>
            </programlisting>
            <programlisting>
<![CDATA[Cat cat = entityManager.find( Cat.class, catId );
cat.setName( "Garfield" );
entityManager.flush(); // generally this is not explicitly needed]]>
            </programlisting>
        </example>
    </section>

    <section>
        <title>Working with detached data</title>

        <para>
            Detachment is the process of working with data outside the scope of any persistence context.  Data becomes
            detached in a number of ways.  Once the persistence context is closed, all data that was associated with it
            becomes detached.  Clearing the persistence context has the same effect.  Evicting a particular entity
            from the persistence context makes it detached.  And finally, serialization will make the deserialized form
            be detached (the original instance is still managed).
        </para>

        <para>
            Detached data can still be manipulated, however the persistence context will no longer automatically know
            about these modification and the application will need to intervene to make the changes persistent.
        </para>

        <section>
            <title>Reattaching detached data</title>
            <para>
                Reattachment is the process of taking an incoming entity instance that is in detached state
                and re-associating it with the current persistence context.
            </para>
            <important>
                <para>
                    JPA does not provide for this model.  This is only available through Hibernate
                    <interfacename>org.hibernate.Session</interfacename>.
                </para>
            </important>
            <example>
                <title>Example of reattaching a detached entity</title>

                </programlisting>
                <programlisting>
    <![CDATA[session.saveOrUpdate( someDetachedCat );]]>
                </programlisting>
            </example>
            <para>
                The method name <methodname>update</methodname> is a bit misleading here.  It does not mean that an
                <literal>SQL</literal> <literal>UPDATE</literal> is immediately performed.  It does, however, mean that an
                <literal>SQL</literal> <literal>UPDATE</literal> will be performed when the persistence context is flushed
                since Hibernate does not know its previous state against which to compare for changes.
            </para>
            <para>
                Provided the entity is detached, <methodname>update</methodname> and <methodname>saveOrUpdate</methodname>
                operate exactly the same.

            <title>Merging detached data</title>
            <para>
                Merging is the process of taking an incoming entity instance that is in detached state and copying its
                data over onto a new instance that is in managed state.
